# graphicalMineSweeper
my take on the classic minesweeper game built in java using jframe and jpanel. Still currently a work in progress however the core gamplay loop (minus ability to flag potential mines) is complete.
  
  TO DO:
  - Add tests for logic imporvements pulled from consoleMineSweeper
  - Improve graphics (do early so that can be displayed on Portfolio)
  - Make a start menu and game over menu
  - In menu allow for player to select difficulty affecting map size and number of mines
  - Add the ability to flag suspected mines
  - Add save functionality for high scores
