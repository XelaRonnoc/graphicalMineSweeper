# graphicalMineSweeper
  - my take on the classic minesweeper game built in java using jframe and jpanel. Still currently a work in progress however the core gamplay loop (minus ability to flag potential mines) is complete.
  
  TO DO:
    - Make a start menu and game over menu
    - in menu allow for player to select difficulty affecting map size and number of mines
    - add the ability to flag suspected mines
    - Add save functionality for high scores
    - Improve graphics
